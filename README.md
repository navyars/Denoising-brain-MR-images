## Rough set based bilateral filter design for denoising brain MR images
'main.m' is the entry point to the program.

This project is an implementation of the paper titled "Rough set based bilateral filter design for denoising brain MR images". In this paper the bilateral filters are improved by using rough set theory. Rough set theory is used to get the edge information even under noise as it handles the uncertainty in the data.
